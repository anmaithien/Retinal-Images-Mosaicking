# Retinal-Images-Mosaicking
This is my first Computer Vision project focusing on improving retinal images

OCT angiography (OCT-A) methods allow us to image the retinal vascular perfusion. There is a fundamental trade-off between vascular resolution and imaging field of view in OCT-A such that microvasculature are only visible when imaging small volumes. This is particularly detrimental for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening because microvascular changes occur in early-stage disease before the onset of retinal hemorrhage and scar tissue formation. However, successful disease screening requires surveillance of the entire retina out to the periphery over multiple longitudinal follow-up exams. Robust volumetric co-registration can overcome these trade-offs between resolution and field-of-view by enabling multi-volumetric mosaicking. Several small field-of-view, high-resolution OCT-A volumes can be acquired over the entire retina and combined in post-processing into a single three-dimensional dataset for quantitative analysis. The goal of this project is to explore registration methods for enabling robust mosaicking.
